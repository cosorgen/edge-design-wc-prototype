# Edge Design Web Component Prototype

## Setup

You need to add a `.env` file to the root of the project with the contents from `example.env`

Then run the following

```bash
artifacts-npm-credprovider
npm ci
npm run build:packages
npm run dev
```

http://localhost:4000 should automatically open and refresh to see your work.
